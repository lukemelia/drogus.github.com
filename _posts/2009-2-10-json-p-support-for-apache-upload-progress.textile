Just a quick note about new feature added to apache upload progress and jquery upload progress libs.

"Ron Evans aka deadprogrammer":http://deadprogrammersociety.blogspot.com/ has added support for JSON-P in "this commit":http://github.com/drogus/apache-upload-progress-module/commit/20fed47119d3ea70b91ccb6a91a9338c8f127304. What does it mean? Cross domain requests are now possible, so if you need such a functionality pull the newest changes.

Here is Ron's description from README:
<blockquote>
- JSON-P Support

You can also request progress updates by using JSON-P, if you are uploading the file from a different domain or  subdomain than the web server that is handling your original request. Adding a "callback=yourCallbackFunction" parameter  to your request to the progress server will activate this functionality. 

For example, a request like:
  http://uploads.yourdomain.com/progress?callback=jsonp123&X-Progress-ID=1234
  
Would return the JSON-P function: 
  jsonp123(new Object({ 'state' : 'uploading', 'received' : 35587, 'size' : 716595, 'speed' : 35587 }));
  
The normal JSON request:
  http://www.yourdomain.com/progress?X-Progress-ID=1234

Would return the JSON data: 
  new Object({ 'state' : 'uploading', 'received' : 35587, 'size' : 716595, 'speed' : 35587 })
</blockquote>

Remember to update "jquery upload progress":http://github.com/drogus/jquery-upload-progress/tree/master also, to use jsonp.

Enjoy :)
