        <h1>Dear 37signals,</h1>
        <p>I've heard that you're looking for <strong>rails programmer</strong> and I think 
        that <strong>I'm the guy</strong>! I figured out that I could
        do something more interesting than plain text and learn some new things in the same time, which resulted in
        that presentation.</p>
        <p>

        <p>Enjoy!</p>

        <h1>I'm Piotr Sarnacki</h1>
        <p>
          You could heard about me because of <strong>Ruby Summer of Code</strong>. I was working on mountable applications
          project.
        </p>
        <p></p>

      <div class="slide" data-id="why-me">
        <h1>Why me?</h1>

        <p>I'm a passionate programmer with great dose of curiosity and urge for challenges. I've been working commercially with
        ruby and rails for about 4 years now.
        Not only I have experience in writing web applications using rails,
        but also I know rails internals very well, thanks to my work during Ruby Summer of Code. At the moment I have 251 commits
        in rails master branch:</p>

        <pre><code>[ ~/rails ]$ git shortlog -s --author="Sarnacki" | grep "Sarnacki"
251  Piotr Sarnacki
        </code></pre>

        <p>Until now I worked mainly as a freelancer. It taught me developing web apps as a whole, from the beginning to the end.
        It also taught self organization, which is needed, if you're not bounded by 9-5 office work.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="slide" data-id="why-me-2">
        <p>Besides working with ruby, I feel comfortable with Javascript, HTML and CSS. Although I'm not a good designer, I can
        implement esthetic user interfaces.</p>

        <p>
          I develop applications using TDD approach and I have broad experience with integration tests,
          including usage of browser based tools like selenium or watir.
        </p>

        <p>
          If there is a need I can get to lower levels of abstraction and dive into advanced SQL or write ruby C extensions (or an
              <a href="https://github.com/drogus/apache-upload-progress-module">apache module</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm not a native speaker, but I think I have good communication skills and I feel that language will not be a barrier here.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="slide smaller" data-id="why-you">
        <h1>Why do I want to work for you?</h1>

        <p>First of all, your attitude is great and I think that you're one of the best companies to work for.
        It's also very important, that you actually have fun running the company and don't want to sell it.
        That's why I care for that job and I don't think about it as temporary one.</p>

        <p>
          I like learning and I know that I can learn <strong>a lot</strong> from you.
        </p>

        <p>
          I read both <em>Rework</em> and <em>Getting Real</em> and I agree with ideas gathered there.
          It must be great to work for a company that teaches work philosophy rather than tries to adopt one.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="slide smaller" data-id="weaknesses">
        <h1>My weaknesses</h1>

        <p>No one is perfect and I think that you should know about my weaknesses.</p>

        <p>
          I lack self confidence. I fight it by leaving my comfort zone as often as I can, but I feel that I could
          achieve much more after getting rid of that completely.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although I try to be pragmatic and use my time as well as I can, sometimes I can't help it and I spend
          half of the night trying to debug some problem that I could deal with the other way or solve it next day
          in the morning with clear mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm also aware that my English is not perfect, but I constantly try to learn and extend my vocabulary.

<p>This presentation was done using jQuery and jQuery Mobile for touch events. The great inspiration for doing that was
awesome <a href="http://slides.html5rocks.com/#landing-slide">HTML 5 presentation</a>. I also use <a href="http://github.com/schacon/showoff">showoff</a>
for all of my presentations and I always wondered how hard would it be to create presentation from zero.
It turns out that it's not so hard.
